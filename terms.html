        <h2 id="-terms-conditions-"><strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong></h2>
        <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
            that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part
            of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the
            app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The
            app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights
            related to it, still belong to Pedro Paulo.</p>
        <p>Pedro Paulo is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
            reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.
            We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
            paying for.</p>
        <p>The TJ Droid app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my
            Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
            that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and
            limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
            malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the TJ
            Droid app won’t work properly or at all.</p>
        <p>The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics for

        </ul>
        <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Pedro Paulo will not take responsibility for. Certain
            functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be
            Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Pedro Paulo cannot take responsibility for the app
            not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
            allowance left.</p>
        <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement
            with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider
            for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party
            charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
            charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
            roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we
            assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
        <p>Along the same lines, Pedro Paulo cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need
            to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail
            the Service, Pedro Paulo cannot accept responsibility.</p>
        <p>With respect to Pedro Paulo’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
            important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times,
            we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Pedro
            Paulo accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on
            this functionality of the app.</p>
        <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements
            for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
            and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Pedro Paulo does not promise that
            it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you
            have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered
            to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
            notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
            licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
            from your device.</p>

        <p>I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page

            this page.</p>
